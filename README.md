# VLMEmbed
## Set up env
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
cd VLM_Embed
python -m venv vlm
source vlm/bin/activate
```
## Set up
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Download dataset
1. Download the eval image file zip from huggingface (`optional`) 
```bash
cd VLM_Embed
hf download TIGER-Lab/MMEB-eval images.zip \
  --repo-type dataset \
  --local-dir .
unzip images.zip -d eval_images/
```
2. Download train image, it can take > 1 hour to download
```bash
cd VLM_Embed
bash download_traindata.sh
bash download_traindata_2.sh
```
3. Fix some line code 

Because of the error of code in **Transformers library**, run the following script to find the error and comment some lines: 

Just comment the following code, from line 140 to 143 in file **/vlm/lib/python3.12/site-packages/transformers/models/qwen2_vl/image_processing_qwen2_vl.py**: 
```python
if size is not None and ("shortest_edge" not in size or "longest_edge" not in size):
    raise ValueError("size must contain 'shortest_edge' and 'longest_edge' keys.")
else:
    size = {"shortest_edge": 56 * 56, "longest_edge": 28 * 28 * 1280}
```
Or run `fix_lib.py` to fix: 
```python 
python fix_lib.py
```

## Training

Just run the scripts in folder `scripts`
- For run RKD: 
```bash
bash scripts/train_RKD.sh
bash scripts/train_distill_propose_V.sh
```
## Inference & Evaluation
1. To evaluate our model on an MMEB dataset (e.g., MSCOCO_i2t), run:
```bash 
bash eval.sh
```

## Acknowledgement
